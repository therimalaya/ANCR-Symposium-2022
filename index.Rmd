## Melanoma

+ Serious form of skin cancer

+ Pigmentation and UV radiation exposure are the most important risk factors.

+ It can be cured if caught and treated early but if left untreated, it may spread to other parts and can be fatal.

+ Melanoma has increased dramatically in fair skinned population worldwide.
